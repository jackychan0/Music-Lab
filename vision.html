<h1> Our Vision </h1>
<h2> Social Anxiety is a condition that isn't dicussed enough. We at music lab hope to create a safe environment where users who suffer from this condition, are able to relax, listen to music and create.
  <br> <br> MusicLab is a safe space for young people experiencing social anxiety. Rather than being a source of professional therapy, MusicLab uses music therapy and user interaction to ease you into socialisation. We arenâ€™t trying to replace these traditional methods, rather to supplement them and to provide an alternative community based solution. <br> <br>
  This creates a social sharing space that is simple and less stressful than in real life. We hope that by slowly easing you into interactions with others, you are able to feel confident and emulate your new found feelings and behaviours in real life.
